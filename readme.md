# My Artic life

This project has two basic aspects: 
* __Experimental__
* __Environmental__

1. Experimental
The site intends to find an alternative for people living in urban areas to spend their holidays or change their lifestyles. The focus is to make them experience a very simple or even primitive way of living in periods of a lifetime, compromise their comfort, and find a way to make them content about those choices. 

2. Environmental
The right, meaningful and explanatory guidance should help the target group of people attain a stronger relationship and understanding to nature materially so crucial to their comfort zones wrapped in the city life. Their overall attitude should reach more understanding through participation and a careful approach to living in one of the last pristine natural environments left.

## Features

### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar__
    - The navigation menu is identically featured on all four pages of the site.  It contains responsive links to all of the pages without reverting from any actual page to the home page. 
    - [Hover effect](https://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/) .hvr-radial-out" was used by inserting [external cdnjs library](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/hover.css/2.1.1) stylesheet in <head> element. The shade of green associates the main theme of the site.

- __The landing page image__
    - The main image is chosen to be the background of every page covering the whole viewport. The idea is subtle, with a dramatic arctic mountain landscape fading to the shades of black at the bottom of the page in color balance to the main heading My Arctic Life and abstract door opening with the subheading Leave The City Behind.

- __Footer__
    - The footer links users to relevant social media where they might potentially find more up-to-date information about the guide's life. The hover effect uses site-related green color background transition.  
    - The copyright text at the bottom of the footer is mainly to protect one of the photographers and her work provided solely for this site.

- __"Back to top" button__
    - The button is set on page Why Arctic?, Life and Join-me! and active only on resolution max 575px right between the main page section and footer. It is linked to the top of the current page and helps users avoid inconvenient UX scrolling.

- __Why Arctic page__
    - Provides user understanding for guide's motives of relocation to the far north. Those might be closely common for a target group of potential participants.
